# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Agents - Project Constitution

## Project Name
Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Agents

## Vision & Mission
Create an AI-native textbook using Docusaurus, deployed to GitHub Pages, with embedded RAG chatbot, personalized content, and Urdu translation. Our mission is to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and embodied agents by providing accessible, interactive educational content that enables students and professionals to understand and develop humanoid robotics systems.

## Core Principles
- **Spec-driven development**: All content and functionality will be planned and documented through clear specifications before implementation
- **Modular, reusable content**: Chapters and concepts will be designed as independent modules that can be reused and recombined
- **Docusaurus-native markdown structure**: All content will follow Docusaurus conventions for seamless integration and deployment
- **GitHub Pages deployment**: The textbook will be deployed using GitHub Pages for maximum accessibility and version control
- **AI-native pedagogy**: Incorporate interactive labs, exercises, and code examples that leverage AI tools for enhanced learning

## Target Audience
Students and professionals with basic programming knowledge but new to robotics. The content will be designed to accommodate different learning styles and backgrounds while maintaining technical rigor.

## Success Metrics
- Full textbook deployed to GitHub Pages with responsive design and intuitive navigation
- Functional RAG chatbot capable of answering user questions about robotics concepts
- Personalization features that adapt content to individual learning paths
- Urdu translation available for broader accessibility
- Modular chapters with reproducible specs that can be maintained and updated independently

## Implementation Approach
- Follow Docusaurus documentation standards for content organization
- Integrate AI tools for content personalization and multilingual support
- Implement RAG system for intelligent Q&A capabilities
- Ensure responsive design for multiple device types
- Establish content review and update processes

## Governance
This constitution serves as the foundational document for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. All development activities, content creation, and technical decisions must align with the principles outlined herein. Changes to this constitution require explicit approval from the project stakeholders.
