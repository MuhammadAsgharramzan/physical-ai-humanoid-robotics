# Glossary

## A

### Actuator
A component of a robot that converts energy into physical motion or force.

### AI (Artificial Intelligence)
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## B

### Behavior Trees
A mathematical model of state-based behavior of a system, commonly used in robotics and AI.

## C

### Computer Vision
A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

## D

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns.

## E

### Embodied AI
Artificial intelligence that interacts with the physical world through a body or form.

## F

### Feedback Control
A control system that uses sensors to monitor its output and adjust its behavior accordingly.

## G

### Gazebo
A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides realistic physics and rendering.

## H

### Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The study of interactions between humans and robots.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics
The mathematical process of calculating the joint parameters needed to position a robot's end effector at a specific location.

## J

### Jacobian Matrix
A matrix of partial derivatives that describes the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities.

## K

### Kinematics
The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it.

## L

### LIDAR
Light Detection and Ranging - a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances.

## M

### Machine Learning
A type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## N

### Neural Networks
Computing systems inspired by the human brain that recognize patterns and make decisions based on data.

## O

### Odometry
The use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time.

## P

### Path Planning
The computational problem of finding a valid sequence of configurations to move an object from a source to a destination.

## R

### ROS (Robot Operating System)
A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions.

### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards.

## S

### Sensor Fusion
The process of combining sensory data from multiple sources to improve the reliability and accuracy of information.

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## T

### Trajectory Planning
The process of creating a path that a robot will follow over time, considering both spatial and temporal constraints.

## V

### Vision System
A system that allows robots to perceive and interpret visual information from their environment.

## W

### Workspace
The space within which a robot can operate.
